# OK-Site

Oekrainse keuken - the site about Ukrainian cuisine for our Dutch friends. 

Idea belongs to my Ukrainian friend. 

Design and development done by me as my first web development project. 

The site is 90% done, some design issues are still being agreed. 

Almost all the layout were done using grid and flex what reduced usage of media queries. 
I've used JavaScript to add some animations and functional elements for better UX.
I've also used intersection observer api. 

The contact form I've created using Express.js and Nodemailer with the help of this video by  Conor Bailey - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30VeUWxZjS8


The whole project is expected to be completed by the end of June 2021.
