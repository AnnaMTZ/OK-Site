# OK-Site

Oekrainse keuken - the site about Ukrainian cuisine for our Dutch friends. 

Idea belongs to my Ukrainian friend. 

Design and development done by me as my first web development project. 

Almost all the layout was done using grid and flex box. 
I've used JavaScript to add some animations and functional elements for better UX.
I've also used intersection observer api. 

The contact form I've created using Express.js and Nodemailer with the help of this video by Conor Bailey - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30VeUWxZjS8

The project is ready to be hosted, content is still being edited by the client.
