# OK-Site

Oekrainse keuken - the site about Ukrainian cuisine for our Dutch friends. 

Idea belongs to my Ukrainian friend. 

Design and development done by me as my first web development project. 

At this point of time about 80% of html and css (I prefer to use SASS) for the site is completed.
Almost all the layout were done using grid and flex what reduced usage of media queries. 
I've used JavaScript to add some animations and functional elements for better UX.

The whole project is expected to be completed by the end of March 2021.
