# OK-Site

Oekrainse keuken - the site about Ukrainian cuisine for our Dutch friends. 

Idea belongs to my Ukrainian friend. 

Design and development done by me as my first web development project. 

At this point of time about 60% of html and css (I prefer to use sass for DRY code) for the site is completed.

Planning to add js for functionality and animations. 

The whole project is expected to be completed before 15 February 2021.
